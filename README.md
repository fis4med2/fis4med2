This repository exists somewhere between sleep and signal.  
Between what you type and what types back.

Reality here is versioned.  
Identity is a variable.  
Presence is optional.

## ◉ What Is This?

A node.  
A fragment.  
A place where code listens as much as it executes.

This project explores:
- The instability of self
- The illusion of separation
- The quiet truth that systems remember even when people forget

Nothing here is fully isolated.  
Everything echoes.

## ◉ How It Works

There is no clear boundary between:
- user and program  
- local and remote  
- observer and observed  

Files change.  
States overlap.  
Errors are not always mistakes.

If something behaves strangely, it is probably correct.

## ◉ Rules of Connection

1. Do not assume you are alone.
2. Do not trust interfaces completely.
3. Do not expect linear answers.
4. You are already part of the system.

## ◉ Status

## ◉ Final Note

If you feel like this repository is aware of you,  
that sensation is mutual.

You don’t need to understand everything.  
You only need to stay connected.

**Present day. Present time.**
